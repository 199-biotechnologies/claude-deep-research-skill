# Deep Research Skill for Claude Code

A comprehensive research engine that brings Claude Desktop's Advanced Research capabilities (and more) to Claude Code terminal.

## Features

### Core Research Pipeline
- **8.5-Phase Research Pipeline**: Scope → Plan → Retrieve (Parallel) → Triangulate → **Outline Refinement** → Synthesize → Critique → Refine → Package
- **Multiple Research Modes**: Quick, Standard, Deep, and UltraDeep
- **Graph-of-Thoughts Reasoning**: Non-linear exploration with branching thought paths

### 2025 Enhancements (Latest - v2.1)
- **📄 Progressive File Assembly (NEW)**: **UNLIMITED report length** (4K, 10K, 20K, 50K+ words) via section-by-section generation
- **⚡ Parallel Search Execution**: 5-10 concurrent searches + parallel agents (3-5x faster Phase 3)
- **🎯 First Finish Search (FFS) Pattern**: Adaptive completion based on quality thresholds
- **🔍 Enhanced Citation Validation (CiteGuard)**: Hallucination detection, URL verification, multi-source cross-checking
- **📋 Dynamic Outline Evolution (WebWeaver)**: Adapt structure after Phase 4 based on evidence
- **🔗 Attribution Gradients UI**: Interactive citation tooltips showing evidence chains in HTML reports
- **🛡️ Anti-Fatigue Enforcement**: Prose-first quality checks prevent bullet-point degradation

### Traditional Strengths
- **Citation Management**: Automatic source tracking and bibliography generation
- **Source Credibility Assessment**: Evaluates source quality and potential biases
- **Structured Reports**: Professional markdown, HTML (McKinsey-style), and PDF outputs
- **Verification & Triangulation**: Cross-references claims across multiple sources

## Installation

The skill is already installed globally in `~/.claude/skills/deep-research/`

No additional dependencies required for basic usage.

## Usage

### In Claude Code

Simply invoke the skill:

```
Use deep research to analyze the state of quantum computing in 2025
```

Or specify a mode:

```
Use deep research in ultradeep mode to compare PostgreSQL vs Supabase
```

### Direct CLI Usage

```bash
# Standard research
python ~/.claude/skills/deep-research/research_engine.py --query "Your research question" --mode standard

# Deep research (all 8 phases)
python ~/.claude/skills/deep-research/research_engine.py --query "Your research question" --mode deep

# Quick research (3 phases only)
python ~/.claude/skills/deep-research/research_engine.py --query "Your research question" --mode quick

# Ultra-deep research (extended iterations)
python ~/.claude/skills/deep-research/research_engine.py --query "Your research question" --mode ultradeep
```

## Research Modes

| Mode | Phases | Duration | Best For |
|------|--------|----------|----------|
| **Quick** | 3 phases | 2-5 min | Simple topics, initial exploration |
| **Standard** | 6 phases | 5-10 min | Most research questions |
| **Deep** | 8 phases | 10-20 min | Complex topics requiring thorough analysis |
| **UltraDeep** | 8+ phases | 20-45 min | Critical decisions, comprehensive reports |

## Output

Research reports are saved to organized folders in `~/Documents/[Topic]_Research_[Date]/`

Each report includes:
- Executive Summary
- Detailed Analysis with Citations
- Synthesis & Insights
- Limitations & Caveats
- Recommendations
- Full Bibliography
- Methodology Appendix

### Unlimited Report Length (2025 Progressive Assembly)

Reports are generated using **progressive file assembly** - each section is written to file individually, allowing unlimited total length:

- **Quick mode**: 2,000+ words
- **Standard mode**: 4,000+ words
- **Deep mode**: 6,000+ words
- **UltraDeep mode**: 10,000-50,000+ words (**NO UPPER LIMIT**)

How it works:
1. Each section (Executive Summary, Introduction, Finding 1, Finding 2, etc.) is generated individually
2. Sections are written to file immediately using Write/Edit tools
3. Citations tracked continuously across all sections
4. Final report assembled from all sections with complete bibliography

Benefits:
- ✅ No artificial word limits - reports sized by evidence needs
- ✅ Maintains quality throughout (no cognitive fatigue)
- ✅ Each section gets focused generation attention
- ✅ Comprehensive topics with 30+ findings? No problem!

## Examples

### Technology Analysis
```
Use deep research to evaluate whether we should adopt Next.js 15 for our project
```

### Market Research
```
Use deep research to analyze longevity biotech funding trends 2023-2025
```

### Technical Decision
```
Use deep research to compare authentication solutions: Auth0 vs Clerk vs Supabase Auth
```

### Scientific Review
```
Use deep research in ultradeep mode to summarize recent advances in senolytic therapies
```

## Quality Standards

Every research output:
- ✅ Minimum 10+ distinct sources
- ✅ Citations for all major claims
- ✅ Cross-verified facts (3+ sources)
- ✅ Executive summary under 250 words
- ✅ Limitations section
- ✅ Full bibliography
- ✅ Methodology documentation

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be Specific**: Frame questions clearly with context
2. **Set Expectations**: Specify if you need comparisons, recommendations, or pure analysis
3. **Choose Appropriate Mode**: Use Quick for exploration, Deep for decisions
4. **Review Scope**: Check Phase 1 output to ensure research is on track
5. **Leverage Citations**: Use citation numbers to drill deeper into specific sources
